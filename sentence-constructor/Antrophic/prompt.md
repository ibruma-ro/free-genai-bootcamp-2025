📌 Sentence Structure
1️⃣ First Sentence:
[Subject] + [Reflexive Pronoun] + [Auxiliary Verb] + [Past Participle] + [Preposition] + [Noun]

2️⃣ Second Sentence:
[Question Word] + [Auxiliary Verb] + [Subject] + [Past Participle] + [Object] + [Prepositional Phrase]

📌 Clues and Considerations
1️⃣ First Sentence:

"Escape" (échapper) is a reflexive verb in this context, so you need a reflexive pronoun.
In passé composé, reflexive verbs take être as an auxiliary verb, not avoir.
The past participle must agree in gender and number with the subject.
"From" translates as "de", so consider the contraction when combining it with "le zoo."
2️⃣ Second Sentence:

"Have you seen" follows passé composé with avoir as an auxiliary verb.
"Voir" is irregular in past participle form—think about its correct form.
"In the paper" should use the correct preposition for location.
Give it a try! I'll check your answer and help you refine it. 😊

Was my sentence too hard for level A2? What sentence structures would you recommentd for A2?
</student_sentence>
<chat_gpt>
Your sentence was challenging but still manageable for A2, especially with guidance. However, it included:

Passé composé of a reflexive verb (se sont échappés) → Reflexive verbs in the past can be tricky at A2.
An interrogative sentence in passé composé (Avez-vous vu…?) → Inversion for questions is usually introduced at B1 level.
For A2 learners, I’d recommend:

✅ Simpler past actions using passé composé, but avoiding reflexive verbs at first.
✅ Using subject-verb-object (SVO) structure for questions instead of inversion.
✅ Avoiding tricky contractions (like du for de le).
