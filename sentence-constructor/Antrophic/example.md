ðŸ”„ Sentence Structure for A2 Level
Since we want to keep this at A2 level, let's simplify the sentences slightly:

1. First sentence:
"The animals escaped from the zoo"
Structure: [Subject] + [Verb in passÃ© composÃ©] + [Preposition] + [Article] + [Noun]

2. Second sentence (simplified for A2):
"Have you seen the news in the paper?"
Structure: [Question word] + [Subject] + [Verb in passÃ© composÃ©] + [Article] + [Noun] + [Preposition] + [Article] + [Noun]

ðŸŽ¯ Clues and Hints:
1. For the first sentence:
- Think about which auxiliary verb (Ãªtre/avoir) you need with "Ã©chapper"
- Remember that with Ãªtre, the past participle agrees with the subject
- Since "animals" is plural, how should your verb ending change?
- For "from the zoo," you'll need to combine "de" with an article

2. For the second sentence (A2 version):
- Instead of inversion, use "est-ce que" to form your question
- The verb "voir" has an irregular past participle
- Think about which article you need before "journal"

Would you like to try translating these sentences now? I can help guide you through each part!

Note: For a true A2 level, we could further simplify to:
- "Les animaux sont sortis du zoo"
- "Est-ce que tu as vu les nouvelles dans le journal?"

These versions use more common vocabulary while maintaining the same meaning.
